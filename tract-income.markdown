Shaded tracts are used to indicate that over 20% households earn less than $25,000/year.  The most intense gradient shades indicate tracts with up to 81.4% of households that earn less than the visualization threshold. Dashed-out tracts have less than 20% of their households earning less than $25,000/year, and are not considered a low-income tract.
